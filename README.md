## My Additions to the Original Code
- Implemented CLAHE algorithm while training the model.
- Implemented Simplest Colour Balance and Noise Reduction to the results of the model

## Requirements

- Python 3.9.7
- PyTorch 1.10.1
- Open CV 4.5.4.60
- torchvision 0.11.2
- Nvidia GPU (I used Kaggle GPU)

## FAQ

#### Why can't I open the 'Improved_Contrast_Zero_DCE_with_Results.ipynb' file?

The size of the notebook has increased due to inclusion of results. Therefore to view this file you need to download it first to your system.
